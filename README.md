## Why BeeAI?

**üèÜ Build for your use case.** Implement simple to complex multi-agent patterns using [Workflows](/python/docs/workflows.md), start with a [ReActAgent](/python/examples/agents/react.py), or easily [build your own agent architecture](/python/docs/agents.md#creating-your-own-agent). There is no one-size-fits-all agent architecture, you need full flexibility in orchestrating agents and defining their roles and behaviors.

**üîå Seamlessly integrate with your models and tools.** Get started with any model from [Ollama](/python/examples/backend/providers/ollama.py), [Groq](/python/examples/backend/providers/groq.py), [OpenAI](/python/examples/backend/providers/openai_example.py), [watsonx.ai](/python/examples/backend/providers/watsonx.py), and [more](/python/docs/backend.md#supported-providers). Leverage tools from [LangChain](/python/examples/tools/langchain.py), connect to any server using the [Model Context Protocol](/python/docs/tools.md#mcp-tool), or build your own [custom tools](/python/docs/tools.md#creating-custom-tools). BeeAI is designed to integrate with the systems and capabilities you need.

**üöÄ Scale with production-grade controls.** Optimize token usage through configurable [memory strategies](/python/docs/memory.md), persist and restore agent state via [(de)serialization](/python/docs/serialization.md), generate structured outputs, and execute generated code in a sandboxed environment (coming soon). When things go wrong, the [emitter](/python/docs/emitter.md) system tracks the full agent workflow, generating detailed [events](/python/docs/events.md) for monitoring and analysis. [Telemetry](/python/docs/instrumentation.md) and [logging](/python/docs/logger.md) capabilities capture key diagnostic data. When issues arise, BeeAI handles [errors](/python/docs/errors.md) gracefully with clear, well-defined exceptions.

> [!TIP]
> Get started quickly with the [beeai-framework-py-starter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework-py-starter) template.

## Quick example

This example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent workflow using BeeAI framework in Python.

```py
import asyncio
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel
from beeai_framework.tools.search.wikipedia import WikipediaTool
from beeai_framework.tools.weather.openmeteo import OpenMeteoTool
from beeai_framework.workflows.agent import AgentWorkflow, AgentWorkflowInput

async def main() -> None:
    llm = ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite3.1-dense:8b")
    workflow = AgentWorkflow(name="Smart assistant")

    workflow.add_agent(
        name="Researcher",
        role="A diligent researcher.",
        instructions="You look up and provide information about a specific topic.",
        tools=[WikipediaTool()],
        llm=llm,
    )

    workflow.add_agent(
        name="WeatherForecaster",
        role="A weather reporter.",
        instructions="You provide detailed weather reports.",
        tools=[OpenMeteoTool()],
        llm=llm,
    )

    workflow.add_agent(
        name="DataSynthesizer",
        role="A meticulous and creative data synthesizer",
        instructions="You can combine disparate information into a final coherent summary.",
        llm=llm,
    )

    location = "Saint-Tropez"

    response = await workflow.run(
        inputs=[
            AgentWorkflowInput(
                prompt=f"Provide a short history of {location}.",
            ),
            AgentWorkflowInput(
                prompt=f"Provide a comprehensive weather summary for {location} today.",
                expected_output="Essential weather details such as chance of rain, temperature and wind. Only report information that is available.",
            ),
            AgentWorkflowInput(
                prompt=f"Summarize the historical and weather data for {location}.",
                expected_output=f"A paragraph that describes the history of {location}, followed by the current weather conditions.",
            ),
        ]
    ).on(
        "success",
        lambda data, event: print(
            f"\n-> Step '{data.step}' has been completed with the following outcome.\n\n{data.state.final_answer}"
        ),
    )

    print("==== Final Answer ====")
    print(response.result.final_answer)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running the example

> [!Note]
>
> To run this example, be sure that you have installed [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the [granite3.1-dense:8b](https://ollama.com/library/granite3.1-dense) model downloaded.

To run projects, use:

```shell
python [project_name].py
```
